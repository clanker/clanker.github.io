**About me**

I studied electrical engineering at Ohio State where I focused on electromagnetics and microelectronics.
My first job was at IBM Microelectronics in Essex Junction, VT.
I then studied economics at University of Chicago, spending a year as an economist for a downtown Chicago economics consulting firm.
After getting a Master's in statistics at Carnegie Mellon University, I spent five nice years in the lovely state of Iowa getting a PhD in statistics.
Then I moved to the Bay Area for seven years where I worked on a variety of important problems at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.
During a stint in biotech doing modeling and simulation for clinical trials, I became interested in electronics again.
I took Electronics I during Summer 2023 at the nearby University of Rhode Island and decided to go back to electrical engineering and pursue the analog circuit design career I had always wanted. 
Perhaps I foolishly abandoned its pursuit during the '00s when its job market was saturated and digital looked poised to dominate analog circuitry.
